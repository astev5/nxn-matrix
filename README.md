# nxn-matrix
A program that accepts and evaluates an n x n matrix.

## Assignment
Write a program that accepts an n x n matrix.
The program should also:
- Total and display the sum of each row and each column.
- Find the product of each row and column.
- Find the highest and lowest value within the array.

## Constraints
- The number of rows and columns should be the same.
- Use nested for loops and methods.

## Requirements
- Build matrix based on user input (e.g., ask how many rows and columns - they must be the same).
- Use a method to display the matrix using tabs between each element.
- Create methods to display the following:
  - Method 1: The sum of each row.
  - Method 2: The sum of each column.
  - Method 3: The product of each row.
  - Method 4: The product of each column.
  - Method 5: The highest value in the matrix.
  - Method 6: The lowest value in the matrix.
- Loop the program to run until user wants to exit.
- The program should ask user for input (numbers should not be hard coded).
